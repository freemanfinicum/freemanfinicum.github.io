Welcome Everyone :)

I Am called Edward Freeman Reidhead and I Am creating Financial Independence in my life here and now.  Anyone that is committed to being 100% responsible for their finances may choose to create the own Bitcoin/crypto-currency accounts now.  I invite Everyone to create their free accounts and experience complete ownership and responsibility for their finances.  Included here are links to open and create your own free Bitcoin/Crypto-currency accounts.  I find that using a couple of accounts works best for me.  At this time, I am personally available for questions regarding Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies.  I choose to be completely responsible for my personal finances and you can also.
